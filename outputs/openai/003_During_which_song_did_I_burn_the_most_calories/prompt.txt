User Query: During which song did I burn the most calories

Personal Health Data:
Age: 25 years
Gender: Other
Height: 182 cm
Weight: 118 kg
Workout Type: HIIT
Workout Duration: 63 minutes
Calories Burned: 256
Heart Rate: 90 bpm
Steps Taken: 8,086
Distance: 6.12 km
Workout Intensity: High
Sleep Hours: 8.0 hours
Water Intake: 1.9 liters
Daily Calories Intake: 3,064
Resting Heart Rate: 86 bpm
VO2 Max: 38.4
Body Fat: 28.5%
Mood Before Workout: Happy
Mood After Workout: Neutral

Your task is to:
1. Determine the most appropriate visualization mode for the insight, choosing from:
   - Donut chart
   - Bar chart  
   - Icon-based chart
   - Text-only with color/icon emphasis

2. Generate a single compact SVG suitable for a smartwatch screen (approximately 360x360 pixels). The SVG must be:
   - Visually clear and glanceable
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Aesthetically pleasing, with components contrasting the background
   - Self-contained (no external styles or dependencies)
   - Labeled with meaningful titles, units, or icons where appropriate
   - In the style of a visual that would be seen on a smartwatch

Focus on the user's perspective: What is most relevant for them to know at a glance right now?

Please respond with only the SVG code, starting with <svg and ending with </svg>.

=== MODEL RESPONSE ===
It seems like there's a misunderstanding. The provided personal health data doesn't include any information about songs listened to during the workout. Therefore, it's not possible to determine during which song the user burned the most calories. Could you please provide the missing data?
